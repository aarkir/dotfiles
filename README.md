My dotfiles

## Usage

Clone into a subdirectory then copy into ~. Note that some files are personalized to me, though they contain no secretive information.

## Notes

- Ctrl-w-w to switch windows on Vim
- make sure `$ vim --version | grep clipboard` is positive to use system clipboard
- open NERDtree with `:NERDTree`
- `:bp` to go to previous file. same for `n`,`f`,`l`, and `w`
